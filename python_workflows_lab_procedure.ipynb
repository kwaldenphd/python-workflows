        "Let's imagine a scenario in which you need to create classes for members of the Notre Dame community. You might need specific classes for `undergraduate students`, `graduate students`, `faculty`, `staff`, `alumni`, `family members`, etc. While the classes would be different, they would all likely share some common elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than repeat all of those common elements, we could use **inheritance** to create a hierarchy of classes. We could start with a parent `person` class that lays out the common elements, and then create sub-classes that would have distinct properties but also **inherit** properties from the parent class.\n",

An object which inherits from another object is considered to be a subtype of that object. An example might include Instructor and Student, each of which inherit from Person. When we can describe the relationship between two objects using the phrase is-a, that relationship is inheritance.\" (Dave Braunschweig, \"<a href=\"https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/inheritance_and_polymorphism/\">Inheritance and Polymorphism</a>\" in <em>Programming Fundamentals</em></blockquote>\n",
